**Question 1**: Which population of humans could be harmed by this app?

1.1 The users located in the remote area without a stable internet.

1.2 Users with temporary or permanent eye disability.   

1.3 The app does not have a function to ensure the quality of foods sent by restaurants, which may lead to diseases and other health issues, this would harm the individuals who receive foods from the food banks and the reputation of the food banks.

**Question 2**: What harms will each of the above-identified populations face?

2.1 The app needs to be connected to the Internet to upload food and get food information, and users living in remote areas cannot guarantee normal Internet access.Compared with farmers with a better Internet environment, farmers in these remote areas cannot obtain the latest information about food from the APP in a timely manner, which will affect the supply of food and the updated prices of commodities, thereby affecting the user experience. Donors could not upload excess food to the platform in time, and rescued people could not apply for food in time.

2.2 Some employees with temporary or permanent eye disabilities in the food banks or charities are responsible for contacting the restaurants.    
They can do their jobs by calling on phones to provide information or book delivery days. However, since there is no screen reading functionality on the product lists  page or restaurants' contact information page, those employees can barely check the donated food information provided by the restaurants and contact them.   

2.3 During the process in which the food is being transferred from the restaurants to the food banks, the app does not specify any kind of standard, nor provide any protection to the food to ensure its quality. In the low-fidelity mockups drafted in the proposal, the donation simply asks for a photo and a brief description of the food; this information is usually not sufficient for food banks to correctly identify the product. It is likely that the food is not in good quality or the brief description is missing some key aspect of the product. If food banks receive these bad food and give these food to people who need help, then it may cause illnesses to those people due to the low quality of food resources or the missing information. Consequently, food banks and any other nonprofit organizations who use this app would be harmed as it would negatively impact their reputation, which is crucial as their goal as charitable organizations is the well-being of our society.
